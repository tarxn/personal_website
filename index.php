        <h2>Prof. Kavya Dashora</h2>

        <p>

            Prof Kavya Dashora is on an extraordinary and multidimensional journey, ranging from microscopic to nano-scopic world. She studies different aspects of nanosynthesis, their residue, nanotoxicity, regulations and approach to green and sustainable crop production.
            Her work also encompasses the discovery of physicochemical properties and bioprocessing of lignolytic enzymes , impact of nanoparticles on plant metabolites and microbial enzymes.
            Her key achievement is also highlight as development of first ever plant based egg in India. She works on different aspects of plant based meats to ensure sustainable nutrition to the growing population.
            Her work essentially involves achieving SDGs in all her projects.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            Prof Dashora completed her PhD from prestigious Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI-ICAR) on developing low-cost biocontrol solutions for pearl millet smut caused by Tolyposporium penicillarie

        <h3>From biodiversity hotspots to nanobiochemicals</h3>
        <p>
        Her interest in underutilized and endangered medicinal plants and their biotic stress helped her to contribute for National Gene Bank of India at National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources. There she did extensive survey in Sahayadri Mountains of Western Ghats (One of the biodiversity hotspots of India) to study about the germination potential of wild varieties of medicinal, endangered and rare plants along with the host parasite interaction, pest predator ratio and their threshold limits for natural pest management.

    <h3>From Biondynamic IPM to nanotechnology for safe agriculture</h3>
        <p>
        Prof Dashora had a dual interest from biodynamic IPM implemented in large plantation crops ensuring the natural ecological balance of pest-predator, natural enemy with green ways for sustainable agriculture and the wonderful, unexplored world of microbes under the microscope. With these interests, she developed translational mode of research to translate the best lab practices into best land practices. Driven by a desire to understand how things work at micro and subsequently nano level in plants-soil-microbe interaction, she further went on to pursue research in nanotechnology and the impact of nanoparticles on soil and microbial enzymes, nanotoxicity, green nanosynthesis, and regulation of nanoparticles in agriculture.
