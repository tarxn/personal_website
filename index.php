                    A journey from tiny hands on the globe to a giant leap across the planet……….<br><br>

Even as young as an eight-year-old, Prof Kavya Dashora was very clear that she wanted to travel across the planet and explore the unexplored. Holding her tiny hands and walking with her little feet with her father who is her first guiding light, she got a model of globe and then firmly set her eyes on the target with no and never looking back. Thoroughly backed by her family of academicians, she had always raised the bar for herself to achieve more and maximum.
Her extensive travel to different countries in developed and developing world with her professional mentor made her thought process evolved for connecting the last mile to high end lab research. Her experience and learnings about the impact of accessibility, sustainability and sensitivity of research is clearly reflected in all her work. <br>

 As a young achiever, Prof Dashora boasts several international awards like Above and Beyond Award, Innovation in Food Award, Best Woman Scientist, UNDP Award for Innovate4SDG, etc and several reputed research publications, training compendium, research documents, regulatory reports, etc .  With an unfeigned modesty, she sums up her achievements as a fine balancing act between stimulation and pressure. <br>
Extremely organized in her work and time management, Prof Dashora knows that successful research depends on rigorous methodology: “Often researchers find writing methodology and protocols before they hit the workstation as a waste of time, but it’s very important to know where you’re going”. Prof Dashora is very particular about timelines and time bound targets and encourage students to stick to timelines so that research outputs are used as relevant in given time frame. 
Her motto and message are ‘If you waste time, time wastes you’.
